            Don Dunstan (1926–1999) was a South Australian politician. He was
            first elected as Member for Norwood in 1953 and rose to prominence
            in the late 1950s for campaigning against the death penalty. He
            became the attorney-general of South Australia in 1965 and premier
            on 1 June 1967. After resigning in 1968, he returned as premier
            after the 1970 election, the first of four successive election wins.
            His administration was socially progressive, enacting
            anti-discrimination laws, expanding voting rights, and increasing
            the public service sector. However, the economy began to stagnate
            and the burgeoning public service generated claims of waste. His
            popularity decreased in 1978 when unsubstantiated rumours of
            corruption and personal impropriety began, and he was accused of
            improperly interfering with a judicial investigation. In 1979 he
            collapsed from ill health and resigned from the premiership shortly
            afterward. He continued to campaign for progressive social policy
            until his death in 1999.

            Electromagnetic phenomena are defined in terms of the
            electromagnetic force, sometimes called the Lorentz force, which
            includes both electricity and magnetism as different manifestations
            of the same phenomenon. The electromagnetic force plays a major role
            in determining the internal properties of most objects encountered
            in daily life. The electromagnetic attraction between atomic nuclei
            and their orbital electrons holds atoms together. Electromagnetic
            forces are responsible for the chemical bonds between atoms which
            create molecules, and intermolecular forces. The electromagnetic
            force governs all chemical processes, which arise from interactions
            between the electrons of neighboring atoms. Electromagnetism is very
            widely used in modern technology, and electromagnetic theory is the
            basis of electric power engineering and electronics including
            digital technology.

            Passports were an important part of the Chinese bureaucracy as early
            as the Western Han (202 BCE-220 CE), if not in the Qin Dynasty. They
            required such details as age, height, and bodily features. These
            passports (zhuan) determined a person's ability to move throughout
            imperial counties and through points of control. Even children
            needed passports, but those of one year or less who were in their
            mother's care may not have needed them.

            The theory is "special" in that it only applies in the special case
            where the spacetime is "flat", that is, the curvature of spacetime,
            consequence of the energy-momentum tensor and representing gravity,
            is negligible. In order to correctly accommodate gravity, Einstein
            formulated general relativity in 1915. Special relativity, contrary
            to some historical descriptions, does accommodate accelerations as
            well as accelerating frames of reference.

            The fifth painting, <em>Desolation</em>, shows the results decades
            later. The remains of the city are highlighted in the livid light of
            a dying day. The landscape has begun to return to wilderness and no
            humans are to be seen; but the remnants of their architecture emerge
            from beneath a mantle of trees, ivy, and other overgrowth. The
            broken stumps of the pharoi loom in the background. The arches of
            the shattered bridge and the columns of the temple are still
            visible; a single column looms in the foreground, now a nesting
            place for birds. The sunrise of the first painting is mirrored here
            by a moonrise, a pale light reflecting in the ruin-choked river
            while the standing pillar reflects the last rays of sunset. This
            gloomy picture suggests how all empires could be after their fall.
            It is a harsh possible future in which humanity has been destroyed
            by its own hand.

            The initial conflict to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait began with an
            aerial and naval bombardment on 17 January 1991, which continued for
            five weeks. During this period, Iraq began to launch missiles into
            Israel with the aim of provoking a response by the Israeli military,
            which the Iraqi leadership expected to prompt the coalition's Muslim
            states to withdraw and therefore jeopardize the alliance against
            Iraq. As the Iraqi missile campaign against Israel failed to
            generate the desired response, Iraq also launched Scud missiles at
            coalition targets stationed in Saudi Arabia. This was followed by a
            ground assault by the coalition into Iraqi-occupied Kuwait on 24
            February. The offensive was a decisive victory for coalition forces,
            who liberated Kuwait and promptly began to advance past the
            Iraq-Kuwait border into Iraqi territory. 100 hours after the
            beginning of the ground campaign, the coalition ceased its advance
            and declared a ceasefire. Aerial and ground combat was confined to
            Iraq, Kuwait, and areas straddling the Iraq-Saudi Arabia border.

            The symbol is a yellow or orange chrysanthemum with black or red
            outlines and background. A central disc is surrounded by a front set
            of 16 petals. A rear set of 16 petals are half staggered in relation
            to the front set and are visible at the edges of the flower. An
